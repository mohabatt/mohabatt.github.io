## Fall 2023
This term, I am teaching Differential Equations (Math 367), Introductory Statistics (Stat 101), and Business Mathematics (Math 105). Students in my courses should contact me via [email](mailto:mtarkesh@stfx.ca) or refer to the course [moodle page](https://moodle.stfx.ca).

## Winter 2023
In the winter of 2023, I taught two tutorial sections of Intermediate Linear Algebra ([MATH 2120B](https://www.uwo.ca/math/undergraduate/current_students/course_information/course-outlines-directory/2022/MATH2120B-2023.pdf)). You can access my tutorial notes [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cl9swvbziansvdx/AAAabqYYg4leLZIuBxfiNKZna?dl=0).

## Fall 2022
In the fall of 2022, I taught two sections of Calculus I ([CALC 1000A](https://www.uwo.ca/math/undergraduate/current_students/course_information/course-outlines-directory/2022/CA1000A_blended.pdf)). Access my lecture notes [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5jp1i1fh25br3sf/AAB7AT7WPBLttaZcJcFuTScka?dl=0). 

## Past experience
During my masters degree in 2017-2018, and from 2019 onwards during my PhD program, I worked as a graduate teaching assistant in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.uwo.ca/) at Western University. I conducted tutorials, hosted office hours, and graded assessments as part of my duties. These courses included:

## Directed Reading Program (DRP)
I supervised various undergraduate students as part of the [Directed Reading Program](https://www.uwo.ca/math/undergraduate/current_students/directed_reading_program.html) (DRP) in the fall of 2020 and 2021. These projects included an introduction to point-set topology using category theory and an introduction to convex geometry. If you're an undergraduate interested in completing a DRP with me, please feel free to [drop me an email](mailto:mtarkesh@uwo.ca).

## Private tutoring
I privately tutor undergraduate students for all mathematics courses. For my current availability, please [email me](mailto:mtarkesh@uwo.ca).

## Other
During the year in between my masters and PhD, I was an instructor at [Seneca College](https://www.senecacollege.ca/home.html) in Toronto. I was a part of the wonderful team in the [Pre-Health Sciences Pathway to Advanced Diplomas and Degrees (PHS)](https://www.senecacollege.ca/programs/fulltime/PHS.html) program.
